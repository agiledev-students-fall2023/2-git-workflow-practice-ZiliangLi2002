## An Interesting Article
Harvard Business Review: [What Is It Like to Be a Software Engineer?](https://hbr.org/2021/07/career-crush-what-is-it-like-to-be-a-software-engineer) by Kelsey Alpaio.

## What I found Interesting
1. Although companies or software teams may use different task management tools, there are similarities between the structure of the tools. The author's software team used Jira, but events such as Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, and Backlog Grooming are nearly identical with the events used in Agile.
2. The author comprehensively described the interview process for software engineering. The resources recommended by the author such as Code2040 and “Cracking the Coding Interview” are helpful.
3. The author claimed that building, testing, and maintaining software is the core skill set for software engineers. A big misconception is that software engineers just code. A large portion of the work is writing documentation to explain things to people or communicate or pitch ideas. 

## Janet Pan's Comment:
As someone who has recently picked up CS and also doesn't have a lot of experience from before, this article was really interesting! It explained some of the foundation and processes, and I found it also pretty helpful when it came to the resources.
